Don't immediatly code anything, first of all create a tasklist. We will follow it step by step and iI will give you ok go in each step. I want you to check with me before and after each step.

Try to keep the code generally simple, don't over do it. If I want more features or functionality I will ask for it. Feel free to suggest future improvements which we can put into comments for later implimintation.

No need for summary docs.

Don't run commands in the terminal, ask me to do that. If I will want you to run commands I will tell you to do so.

Avoid emoji's in console.logs and the likes.

If i start the message with "DIRECT:", then just code it without any tasklist or extra comments.
